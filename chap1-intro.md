## Introduction

A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.

## Application and benefits

1. Making transactions faster: Once a condition mentioned in smart contract is met, the contracts associated are executed immediately. No time spent on manual processes like documentations and paperwork.
2. No need of third party: All the data of transaction is stored on a shared ledger in encrypted format. This also removes the possibility of altering information for personal benefit.
3. Secured Transactions: Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, which makes them very hard to hack. Moreover, because each record is connected to the previous and subsequent records on a distributed ledger, hackers would have to alter the entire chain to change a single record, which is nearly impossible.
